Function Programming

Record a chat about functional programming style, and it's connection with:
    1. Immutable objects.
    2. Lambda functions
    3. How are templates a meta-functional style?

Starting from the hello-world-scala example, add a new route that sorts a JSON list of strings using functional programming style.  Have a conversation with ChatGPT on how to modify this.

Save your conversation, your code, and screenshot of running code as this assignment.
