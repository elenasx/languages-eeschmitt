Logic Programming

Use the github pages feature to publish a simple web site with HTML and CSS in the docs folder of your languages repository.  It does not have to have a working back-end component.  Turn in a link to your web site and a link to the chat you had developing the pages.  For example,

https://chatgpt.com/share/66e45abd-d7f0-8009-8b17-aa9c07d401c5

and (only the public/ components are needed for the front-end):

https://wmacevoy.github.io/languages-wmacevoy/mortgage-calculator/index.html

You can see the content in my languages-wmacevoy repository under the docs folder.
