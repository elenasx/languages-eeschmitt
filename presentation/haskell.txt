https://medium.com/sourcescribes/what-is-haskell-853b6949a800:
No statements or instructions, only expressions that cannot mutate variables or access states like time or random numbers.
Programs are written like mathematical functions
Monads: describes computations as sequences of steps which handle side effects. Constructed on top of a polymorphic type such as IO. Used for input/output, error handling, and state management.
Monad class has three functions: 
    return: takes value and puts it in monadic context 
    (>>=): "bind" chains together monadic computations
    (>>): "then" sequences two monadic computations, ignoring the result of the first

Monads
Provide a way to handle computations that can cause side effects, like input and output while keeping the program pure.
Return: Takes a value "a" and wraps it with the monad, producing m a.
Bind: Allows you to chain together monadic operations. If you need to perform a set of computations that could have side effects, this allows you to use a function on the value inside the monad.
Then: 

Typeclasses
Eq (==) (/=): equality and ineqality
Ord (<, >, <=, >=):
Functor: apply a function to values that are inside a context like maybe, list
